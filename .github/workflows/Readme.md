Workflows that can be run from the [Actions] section on github.

- filename and title specify what the workflow does and its implementation language
- the ones that test "only collection" consider the last version of the models, (the ones that appear on the zoo webpage)
- `test_bioimageio_resources.yaml` is the one that is supposedly called by the zoo's CI, and needs the string json argument (not the file)
